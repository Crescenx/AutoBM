Your task is to design a model to explain the strategies of buyers in the auctions.

### Buyer information data interface

For buyer $b_i$ in round $r$ at time $t$:

#### Normalization Convention

For buyer $b_i$, define the normalization operation:
$$
\text{normalize}_i(x) := \frac{x}{\beta_i}
$$
This applies to all prices or quotes shown to $b_i$, including both the buyer’s own and others’ bids/asks as displayed in the interface. All subsequent notation uses this normalized scaling.

#### Information Interface

```python
# ---------------
# Private Data Structures
# ---------------

class BidHistoryEntry:
    """Represents a single bid submitted by buyer b_i in the current round"""
    normalized_price: float   # q_i^{r,k} / β_i, range [0, 1]
    is_expired: bool          # True if this bid is expired, False if active (see 10-second expiration rule)

# ---------------
# Public Data Structures
# ---------------

class BidOrderEntry:
    """Represents an entry in the bid order book (as seen by b_i)"""
    normalized_price: float   # Sorted descending (best bid first)
    from_current: bool        # True if bid is from b_i, False otherwise

class AskOrderEntry:
    """Represents an entry in the ask order book (as seen by b_i)"""
    normalized_price: float   # Sorted ascending (best ask first)
    from_current: bool        # Always False (asks are from sellers)

# ---------------
# Buyer Interface Variables
# ---------------

current_time: float           # Current time t in the round (seconds)
H: List[BidHistoryEntry]      # Buyer's bid history in current round
Q_active: List[BidOrderEntry] # Order book: active bids (descending order)
A_active: List[AskOrderEntry] # Order book: active asks (ascending order)
P: List[float]                # Recent match history: all normalized match prices in current round
```

The model should provide the likelihood of a buyer’s new bid, given the information available at time $t$ in round $r$:
$$
Pr(q_{r,t} | \text{information}_{r,t})
$$
where $q_{r,t}$ is the normalized price of the new bid.
