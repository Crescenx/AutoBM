        - Explicit requires_grad=True for gradient tracking
        - No inherited computation graph dependencies
        
    Leaf Tensor Guarantees:
        1. Tensors initialized directly with torch.tensor(values)
        2. No values derived from computational operations
        3. requires_grad=True set at creation time
