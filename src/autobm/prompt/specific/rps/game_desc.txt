The repeated RPS game is an iterative strategic interaction where:
1. Two players engage in multiple rounds (typically 50) of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
2. In each round, players simultaneously choose an action a âˆˆ {Rock, Paper, Scissors}.
3. The outcome is determined by standard RPS rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock.
4. Players receive payoffs based on the outcome (typically +1 for win, 0 for tie, -1 for loss).
5. Both players observe the full history of previous actions before each subsequent round.
6. The game continues for the predetermined number of rounds (50), with cumulative payoffs tracked throughout.
