All models **MUST** process data in the following format:
```python
# Batch structure (after preprocessing)
T = 49
batch = {
    "human_hist": Tensor[int],    # shape [B, T]
    "opponent_hist": Tensor[int], # shape [B, T]
    "timestep": Tensor[int],      # shape [B]
}

# Label structure
labels = Tensor[int]  # shape [B] (current human action)
```
And be aware that:
1. The integer representation of actions are described as a action map:
```
action_map = {
    "Rock":0,
    "Scissor":1,
    "Paper":2,
}
```
1. The data is padded to the length of 'T'. Only data in the range [0:timestep] is valid.
