{{ game_desc }}

Here are some models aiming to predict the behavior in the game.
```python
{{ models }}
```
Now analyze these models and think step by step.
Your task is to generate a different model in terms of approach to explore other possibilities of solving the problem.

**Guidlines**:
- You may utilize your knowledge of the game theory and strategic behavior principles.
- Check each model and the parameters/constants/intermediate terms of the model.
- Guidlines:
  - What part of the information provided is not used/well exploit in the model?
  - Are there other completely different aspects that previous models didn't consider? 
  - What new mechanisms/structures/features can be introduced to bring new insights?
- Keep the model clean and interpretable.
- Follow the guidlines and think step by step.
