Here are some models aiming to predict the behavior in the game.

{{ models }}

Now analyze these models .
Your task is to develop a better-performing model by utilizing the insights from these models.

**Guidlines**:
- You may utilize your knowledge of the game theory and strategic behavior principles.
- Analyze each model and the judgement of the model.
- Guidlines:
  - Considering the models' structures and the terms used, which ones are the most powerful, which ones are the weakest?
  - If the term is powerful, how can it be further improved? If the term is weak, how can it be removed or replaced?
  - Are there other aspects that previous models didn't consider? What new mechanisms/structures/features can be introduced to improve the model?
  - How to more effectively combine the terms? How to more effectively exploit the information structure.
- Keep the model clean and interpretable.
- Follow the guidlines and think step by step
