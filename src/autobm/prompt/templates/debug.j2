Debug & Optimization Instructions

1. Debugging  
   - [ ] Analyze the error log to identify distinct error categories (e.g., shape/dtype mismatches, None values, API misuse, in-place operations).  
   - [ ] For each category, locate all occurrences in the code and apply a single systematic fix across every instance.  
   - [ ] Summarize each error type and the uniform correction applied.

2. Tensor Consistency & Vectorization  
   - [ ] Convert every list or NumPy array into `torch.Tensor` before use; remove all `.detach()`/`.data` except for true constants.  
   - [ ] Eliminate Python loops and list comprehensions on tensors; replace with native vectorized operations.  
   - [ ] Replace any `.apply_()` calls with built-in tensor methods (e.g. `tensor.pow(2) + 1`).  

3. Computational Graph & Gradient Safety  
   - [ ] No use of `.numpy()` or `.item()` inside forward/backward computations.  
   - [ ] Control flow on tensors only via Python `if/else` with scalar conditions; avoid `torch.where` for branching.  
   - [ ] Replace in-place updates (`x += y`) with functional equivalents (`x = x + y`), using `x.clone()` if needed.  

4. Policy & Interface Validation  
   - [ ] Confirm the refactored code still meets the given policy requirements.  
   - [ ] Ensure the data interface contract remains unchanged.  

Output Requirements  
- First, provide a concise chain-of-thought summarizing your grouped error identification and correction steps.  
- Then, in a single Python code block, output **only** the fully corrected code.  
- Do **not** include any example usage, tests, or extra commentary.
